# SimplifiedDES
Java implementation of the SimplifiedDES algorithm as described here: [University of Rhode Island](https://www.cs.uri.edu/cryptography/dessimplified.htm).

Uses keys of 9 bits and messages of 12 bits.
It can encrypt and decrypt. 
Implemented also a brute force attack and the Differential Cryptanalysis to compare their effectiveness.
